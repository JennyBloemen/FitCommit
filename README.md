<h1>FitCommit</h1>

<h3>Description</h3>
  <p> FitCommit is a free restful API application designed to help users personalize fitness workouts based on a seven-day weekly schedule. The application has a one-time sign up feature that allows a user to create an account with authentication that is encrypted for security.

Once an account is created, the user is automatically logged in and can start personalizing a weekly schedule. The schedule is unique to each user and displays the users name in the heading. The schedule page uses a form that is designed to accept and respond to user input, adding custom text based on the day of the week. The form can also be used to update previously scheduled data. The schedule page includes a delete button feature to remove data based on the day of the week. Sweetalert2, a new node package, is used to create a customized popup box to ensure deletion is intentional.

The application also contains an exercises page, with data populated from the database. This page is for users to browse and obtain ideas to add to their schedule.
